## 📘 Chapters Overview

### **Chapter 1 – Edge Detection and Thresholding**
- Applies Otsu’s Thresholding and Canny Edge Detection.
- Demonstrates image preprocessing fundamentals.

### **Chapter 2 – Connected Components and Region Descriptors**
- Detects and labels multiple objects in an image.
- Marks centroids and bounding boxes for each region.

### **Chapter 3 – Hough Transform (Circle Detection)**
- Implements circle detection using the Hough Transform.
- Ideal for detecting circular shapes like coins or wheels.

### **Chapter 4 – YOLO-based Object Detection**
- Uses Ultralytics YOLOv8 model for object detection.
- Demonstrates AI-powered real-time detection.

### **Chapter 5 – Face Detection with Morphology**
- Uses morphological operations and Haar Cascade Classifier.
- Enhances image quality and detects faces accurately.
